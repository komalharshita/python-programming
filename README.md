🐍 Python Programming

Welcome to my Python Programming Repository!
This repo is a collection of Python programs and exercises that I’ve written while learning the language. It is organized topic-wise, making it easy to browse, understand, and practice different Python concepts.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (3.10+ recommended)  
- `pip` for installing packages  
- Optional: `virtualenv`/`venv` for isolated environments  
- Optional: `pytest` for running tests

## ⚙️ Setup — create a virtual environment (recommended)

Run these commands in your repo root.

```bash
# create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
